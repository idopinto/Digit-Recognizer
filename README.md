# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network
This project is an implementation of a neural network model for recognizing handwritten digits.

Given an input image of a digit between 0 and 9, the software returns the digit that was identified.

# Overview
The neural network model is built by implementing various classes such as matrix, network layer, and activation function. 

These classes are essential in creating the model itself.
